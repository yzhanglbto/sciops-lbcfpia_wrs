As of Nov-2014, we're using the Ice interface to TCS for the TCSSendWavefront program.
This is built from the lbccontrol/2.1 source area.

                                                            K.Summers, April-2014
                                                                      
The TCSSendWavefront main program is used to read the output from DOFPIA from a 
data file and call TCS IIF_SendWavefront to set the zernikes.

The source is maintained in the LBC baseline because it is LBC-specific.  
It is no longer (as of Summer-2014) maintained as part of the TCS build.

Previous to April-2014, there was a link in this dir 
(/home/lbcobs/LBCFPIA/lbcfpia/TCSSendWavefront) to the TCS version of this 
executable:
lrwxrwxrwx. 1 lbcobs   3000    41 Aug 29  2013 TCSSendWavefront -> /lbt/tcs/current/iif/bin/TCSSendWavefront

The executable should be built on the CMU anytime the IIF interface changes 
(which should be never).

All of the old files have been moved to a new subdirectory called "old".  
This includes the LBC source and libraries used to build the old, old way
from LBC which included LBC libraries.
