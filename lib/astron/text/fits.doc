/FITS directory                                                  12-Dec-2000

FITS (Flexible Image Transport Sytem) is a standardized data format which
is widely used in astronomy.   Information on the FITS format can be obtained 
from the NRAO FITS archive http://fits.cv.nrao.edu or from the FITS support 
office at Goddard at http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/astro/fits/fits_home.html.   I 
note here only that FITS is a binary format, and so the binary option should 
be used when copying FITS files with FTP.

The IDL Astronomy Library contains a variety of procedures for reading, 
writing, and modifying FITS files.   Information on how to use these procedures
is given in http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio.html and is also briefly 
described here.    There are four main types of FITS I/O 
procedures available in the Library:

   (1) MRDFITS() will read all standard FITS data types into IDL arrays (for
primary images and image extensions) or structures (for binary or ASCII tables).
The procedure MWRFITS() will write an IDL structure to a FITS file, with many 
options available (binary or ASCII table, default generation of column names).
These procedures were written by Tom McGlynn (USRA/Goddard).   Further 
information on MRDFITS is available in Appendix 2 below.   
To compile MRDFITS and MWRIFTS the following procedures must be included in
the !PATH
	FXADDPAR, FXPAR(), FXPARPOS()             (in pro/fits_bintable)
	IEEE_TO_HOST, IS_IEEE_BIG(), MRD_SKIP     (in pro/misc)
        GETTOK(), VALID_NUM()
	FXPOSIT, MRD_HREAD                        (in pro/fits)
	MRD_STRUCT()                              (in pro/structure)


   (2) The procedure READFITS can be used to read FITS headers and arrays into
IDL variables.   Additional procedures in the pro/fits_table directory
are then required to interpret binary and ASCII tables.   The FT* procedures in 
the /fits_table directory are used to interpret a FITS ASCII table, and the
TB* procedures are used interpret FITS Binary table.    The procedure WRITEFITS
can be used to write a primary image, ASCII extension, or image extension
(see Appendix 3).      The READFITS/WRITEFITS software currently cannot read 
variable length binary tables, or write any type of binary table.    The
READFITS/WRITEFITS software requires the following procedures from the /misc
directory: GETTOK(), HOST_TO_IEEE, IEEE_TO_HOST, IS_IEEE_BIG(), STRN()
STRNUMBER(), WHERENAN() and WHERE_NEGZERo().

   (3) The directory pro/fits_bintable contains IDL procedures for 
FITS I/O written by Bill Thompson (Goddard/ARC).    This software can be used 
to read or write all types of FITS images and binary 
tables.    The one limitation of these procedures is that they do not handle 
ASCII tables.    Further information on these procedures is available in the 
LaTeX file fits_bintable.tex in the /text directory.

  (4) The five procedures FITS_CLOSE, FITS_HELP, FITS_OPEN, FITS_READ, and
FITS_WRITE were written by D. Lindler (ACC/Goddard) and are used by the
STIS/NICMOS instrument teams on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).    
These procedures are especially efficient for FITS files with many extensions,
and they also recognize conventions used in HST FITS files that are not part
of the standard FITS definition.   Like READFITS/WRITEFITS, these procedures
require further processing of binary and ASCII table, by using procedures
in the /fits_table directory.   In particular, the procedure FTAB_EXT uses 
FITS_READ to provide a quick and easy extraction of FITS ASCII or Binary 
tables into IDL vectors.
    
Besides the four main categories above, other FITS procedures are available to 
read/write FITS files on tape, or to convert between FITS and the STSDAS 
format (.hhh and .hhd files) used for HST data.  (See pro/sdas/README for info
on the STSDAS format.)  This README file should be monitored for improvements 
in the FITS I/O package.

A FITS header is a string array with 80 characters per line.    Using the IDL
PRINT command to display the header will result in a space between every
line.   The HPRINT procedure in the /misc directory will display a FITS
header without this extra space.

The procedures FITS_INFO and FITSDIR use the non-standard system variables 
!TEXTUNIT and !TEXTOUT.   These can be added to one's session using the 
procedure ASTROLIB in the /misc directory.

The available FITS I/O routines can be summarized as follows:          

1.    Disk FITS  <====>   IDL variables 

      The procedure MRDFITS is a very generalized FITS reader that can read
      almost any type of FITS file, including random groups, and variable
      length binary tables.   ASCII and binary columns are directly mapped
      into the tags of an IDL structure.   MWRFITS() will write an IDL 
      structure to a FITS file.   

      READFITS() will read a disk FITS file into IDL data and header arrays. It
      can handle REAL*4 and REAL*8 data and extensions but not random group
      FITS.     READFITS() also has STARTROW and NUMROW keywords to read
      selected rows from a primary image or extension.   Under Unix or IDL V5.3,
      READFITS() can  directly read a gzip or Unix compress file.   ASCII and 
      binary tables require further processing with the FT* and TB* procedures 
      in the /fits_bintable directory.     In particular, FTAB_EXT can be used 
      to extract IDL vectors from a FITS binary or ASCII table.  

      WRITEFITS will write an IDL data and header array to a disk FITS file.   
      It can handle all valid FITS formats except random groups.     Use the 
      /APPEND keyword to WRITEFITS to add a FITS extension to an existing FITS
       file (see Appendix 3).

      The procedure HEADFITS() can be used to read just the FITS header.

      The procedure FXREAD in /fits_bintable can be used as an alternative
      to READFITS for reading a primary array.    It is a procedure rather
      than a function and has the ability to read a subarray or every nth 
      pixel from the primary FITS array.    The procedure FXWRITE in 
      /fits_bintable  can be used as an alternative to WRITEFITS.

      The procedure FITS_INFO displays info about FITS file(s) in a 
      directory.  The info include the number of extensions, and the size
      and type of each header or array.    The procedure FITSDIR displays
      selected keywords from the primary headers in a set of FITS files.

      The procedure RDFITS_STRUCT will read an entire FITS file into an IDL
      structure.   Each header, image or spectra, or table is placed into a 
      separate structure tag.


3.  FITS Tape  <=====> Disk FITS          

    The procedure FXTAPEWRITE will copy a disk FITS file to tape, and 
    FXTAPEREAD will copy a FITS file from tape to disk.    These procedures
    use the intrinsic IDL commands for handling tapes (e.g TAPWRT, TAPRD) that
    are available for VMS only.   However, the /tape_io directory contains 
    procedures written by Bill Thompson (ARC/Goddard) that emulate the
    intrinsic IDL VMS tape I/O command by use of the IOCTL function.
    
     Alternatively, a Unix FITS tape file can be copied to disk using dd, 
    (as in "dd if=/dev/tape of=file.fits bs=2880").

Appendix 2:   MRDFITS - A multiple format FITS reader.   V2.4
Also see http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/mrdfits.html
Last updated: 12-Dec-2000

The MRDFITS utility is intended to be a general purpose function allowing
users to quickly read FITS files in all standard formats.  MRDFITS
returns an array or structure containing the data from the specified
FITS extension.  Header information may optionally be returned as a
string array.  MRDFITS currently supports the following FITS data types:

	Primary simple images
	The IMAGE extension
	Group data in both primary images and IMAGE extensions.
	ASCII tables
	BINARY tables including the suggested convention for
	  variable length records.

MRDFITS uses the dynamic structure definition capabilities
of IDL to generate a structure matching the characteristics of the
FITS data and then reads the data into the structure.  Some tailoring
of the FITS data is possible:

	- A specified range of data may be retrieved.
	- The data may be scaled to FLOAT or DOUBLE values as controlled
	  by the BSCALE (TSCALE) and BOFFSET (TZERO) keywords.
	  Note that the default is no scaling.
	- Only a subset of the columns may be retrieved for ASCII
	  and binary tables.

MRDFITS is called as a function similar to the old READFITS utility, e.g.,

	str = mrdfits(file, exten_no, header)
	
where file is a file name, exten_no is the extension to be read (0 for the
primary data array) and header is an optional variable in which the
header information will be stored.  A number of optional keyword
parameters are available.

	/FSCALE and /DSCALE  cause scaling to single and double precision.
	COLUMNS=  	     allows users to specify the columns desired.
	RANGE=		     allows users to retrieve only some rows.
	STRUCTYP=	     gives the structure type for the structure
	TEMPDIR=	     gives the directory for temporary files
	/SILENT		     suppresses informative messages
	/USE_COLNUM          makes tag names of the form C#
	/NO_TDIM             disable processing of TDIM keywords.
	ERROR_ACTION=	     action specified in on_error
	
	
MRDFITS uses the EXECUTE function where possible but creates temporary
procedures when complex structures are needed.  The MRD_STRUCT
function is used for the dynamic definition of structures.

For calls from other programs, MRDFITS has an output STATUS keyword to indicate whether it was successful. A status of >=0 indicates a successful read. The returned status value has the
following meanings: 

      0 -> successful completion 
     -1 -> error 
     -2 -> end of file 


MRDFITS is largely a standalone utility, but does use the parameter
parsing of FXPAR to find elements in a header.  All I/O is done
within MRDFITS.  The IEEE_TO_HOST routine is called for to convert
data to the local representation.

One known limitation of MRDFITS is that no special handling is done for NULL
values. 

	Note that MRDFITS is not a FITS checker.  It may read in
	files that are not proper FITS since only a few FITS elements
	needed by the reader are actually explicitly checked.  MRDFITS
	should read in all correct FITS files and I would appreciate
	copies of any correct FITS files that break the reader.
	MRDFITS seems to be somewhat stricter about compliance to
	FITS standards than some of the other IDL FITS readers.
	This may be good or bad depending upon your needs.
	
Under IDL V5.3 or later, MRDFITS uses the /COMPRESS keyword to OPENR to allow
it to read gzip'ed files on any machine architecture. Prior to IDL V5.3, this
capability was limited to Unix systems, and decompression was done using a
sub-process and pipes (so that no temporary file is created). MRDFITS can also
read files compressed with `standard' Unix compress utility. MRDFITS assumes
that files ending with .Z, .gz and .GZ are to be decompressed, but it also has
the COMPRESS keyword so that the user can specify that any file is compressed. 

Instead of a file name, MRDFITS() can be given the unit number of an already
opened FITS file. In this case, the EXTEN_NO parameter gives the number of
extensions to skip *from the current location in the FITS file*. The use of a
unit number instead of a file name is more efficient when multiple extensions
of a FITS file are to be read. For example, to process all extension in a FITS
file starting with the third one, one might do the following: 

   lun=fxposit(filename, 3)      ;Open a FITS file and move to extension 3
   repeat begin
          thisHDU = mrdfits(lun, 0, hdr, status=status)
          ... process the HDU ...
   endrep until status lt 0

MRDFITS comprises several files.  he following procedures are included in the
main file mrdfits.pro 

     MRDFITS: The main function with some utilities. 
     MRD_ASCII: Code to handle ASCII tables. 
     MRD_TABLE: Code to handle BINARY tables. 
     MRD_IMAGE: Code to handle simple images and group data. 
     MRD_SCALE: Data scaling. 
     MRD_COLUMNS: Column selection. 


The following procedures are in separate files (because they are of general use) outside of MRDFITS.) 

     MRD_STRUCT: Dynamic structure definition.  (in pro/structure)
     FXMOVE: Skip a specified number of extensions in a FITS file. 
     FXPOSIT: Find an extension in a FITS file. 
     MRD_HREAD: Read a FITS header from an opened disk file or Unix pipe 
     MRD_SKIP Skip a number of bytes from the current location in 
             a file or pipe (in pro/misc) 


On Unix systems MRDFITS can handle files compressed with either
the `standard' Unix compress utility or with the Gnu gzip utility.
It assumes that files ending with .Z, .gz and .GZ are to be
decompressed.  Decompression is done using a sub-process and pipes
so that no temporary file is created.  In the future I anticipate
implementing decompression on other architectures but the process
will likely involve temporary files.

Appendix 3:  Writing an IMAGE Extensions with  WRITEFITS

The format of a FITS IMAGE extension duplicates that of a primary FITS array.  
Thus, unlike binary or ASCII tables extensions, a FITS IMAGE extension does 
not require any further interpretation after it has been read by READFITS with
the EXTEN keyword.    A FITS extension can be added to an existing FITS file 
by using WRITEFITS with the /APPEND keyword.     Users need to make sure that 
(1) the primary FITS header includes an EXTEND keyword, and (2) the required 
keywords of the IMAGE extension header match those described in the defining 
document.   One way to make sure that these criteria are met is to use the 
/EXTEND and /IMAGE keywords of the MKDHR procedure.

	For example,  to create a FITS file with a dummy primary header (i.e.
no primary array) and two IMAGE extensions containing the IDL arrays 
"im1" and "im2"  to a file 'test.fits'

        IDL> mkhdr,h,'',/EXTEN        ;Create a dummy header (NAXIS=0) and
                                      ;include an EXTEND keyword

	IDL> writefits,'test.fits','',h     ;Write the header to disk
                                            ;Since there is no primary image 
                                            ;it is set to ''

	IDL> mkhdr,h1,im1,/IMAGE      ;Make a minimal IMAGE extension header h1 
                                      ;appropriate to the array im1 using 
                                      ;Additional header keywords can be added
                                      ;using SXADDPAR

                                     
	IDL> writefits,'test.fits',im1,h1,/app  ;Append to existing FITS file

        IDL> mkhdr,h2,im2,/IMAGE       ;Create IMAGE header for im2

 	IDL> writefits,'test.fits',im2,h2,/APPEND    ;Append second extension
