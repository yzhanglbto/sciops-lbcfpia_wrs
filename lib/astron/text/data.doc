This directory contains any  data files which are used by procedures
in the IDL astronomy library.   These procedures
look for these data files in a directory with the logical name
ASTRO_DATA (VMS) or the environment name ASTRO_DATA (Unix).

As of May 1998, this directory contains the single file EBCDIC.DAT, which is 
read by STREBCASC.PRO.   It gives the EBCDIC-ASCII conversion codes.
