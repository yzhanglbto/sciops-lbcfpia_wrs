DAOPHOT-type Photometry                                  August, 1997

  These are a set of IDL procedures adapted from an early FORTRAN
  version of DAOPHOT aperture photometry.   The creators of DAOPHOT
  have no responsibility whatsoever for the IDL code.  The IDL code
  will give similar, but not identical, results as the original FORTRAN.
  A slight modification of the procedures for use with digitized 
  photographs is available from the UIT (Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) group. 
  A LaTex file DAOPHOT.TEX  in /text supplies further documentation for 
  the IDL-DAOPHOT procedures for CCD images.

  Before March 1995, the FITS table procedures in this directory would write
  TTYPE* values with embedded spaces.   This practice is strongly 
  discouraged within the FITS community, and has now been changed (e.g.
   "STAR_ID" is written instead of "STAR ID").    A procedure FIXDAOTAB
  is available from Wayne Landsman (landsman@mpb.gsfc.nasa.gov) 
  to correct FITS tables created before March 1995.

  In May 1996, the following updates were made to the code
       (1) Non-standard system variables are no longer used.   The PRINT 
           keyword is used instead of !TEXTOUT, and the DEBUG keyword is used
           instead of !DEBUG.
       (2) The T_* procedures now request the *name* of a disk FITS ASCII table
           for storing the input and output results.  
       (3) NSTAR now has a /VARSKY keyword to allow the skylevel to vary.

 In July 1997, the procedures were modified so that the PSF residuals are
 written to a FITS file, rather than a STSDAS file.    To convert a PSF 
 file 'psfname' created earlier in STSDAS format, use the following commands:
	IDL> sxopen,1,'psfname',h
	IDL> psf = sxread(1)
	IDL> writefits,'psfname.fits',psf,h
