      This directory contains IDL mathematics and statistics procedures
thought to be of interest in astronomy.    Twelve of the procedures,
are adapted from algorithms in "Numerical Recipes 2nd Edition" by Press, 
Flannery,Teukolsky, and Vetterling (1992, Cambridge University Press).    
These procedures are marked below with an "NR"

     The FORTRAN procedure names in "Numerical Recipes" are limited to 
6 characters, and in some cases (e.g. MINF_PARABOLIC for BRENT) we have
chosen more descriptive names for the equivalent IDL procedure.

    Additional IDL mathematics and statistics procedures developed by
Henry Freudenreich (Hughes STX) are available in the contrib/freudenreich
directory.    These include procedures for LOWESS smoothing, robust fitting,
bootstrap errors, and fitting to a plane.
