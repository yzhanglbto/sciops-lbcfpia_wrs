This directory contain IDL procedures for manipulating FITS or STSDAS images
which include header keywords specifying the coordinate system.   The FITS or
STSDAS header must follow the specification in the FITS draft proposal
"Representations of Celestial Coordinates in FITS"  by Eric Greisen and Mark
Calabretta.    Documentation for this proposal can be obtained 
from http://fits.cv.nrao.edu/documents/wcs/wcs.html.    
(Note that -- as of July 2000 -- the preferred notation for the coordinate
description (CD) matrix in a FITS header is with and underscore, i.e., CDn_m.)

Users should be aware that FITS defines the center of the first pixel in
the array to have coordinates (1,1).    This differs from the IDL convention
where the first pixel has coordinates (0,0).    Whenever an (X,Y) position
is extracted or inserted into a FITS/STSDAS header then this difference
must be accounted for.

Special astrometry procedures are required for the Digitized Sky Survey Images
which were released on CD-Rom in early 1994.    Information about the Guidestar
images can be obtained from http://archive.stsci.edu/dss/
and the Guidestar images can also be obtained from the SKYVIEW facility
at http://skyview.gsfc.nasa.gov/skyview.html.  The Schmidt plates used in
this survey have a highly nonlinear plate solution that is not covered
by the Greisen & Calabretta conventions.     The procedures GSSSEXTAST, 
GSSSXYAD and GSSSADXY are the Guidestar survey analogues of the procedures
EXTAST, XY2AD, and ADXY for standard astrometry.     All the astrometry
procedures in the library will test for a Guidestar image header (by looking
for the 'PPO1' keyword) and call the appropriate procedures.    The procedure
GSSS_STDAST will convert the astrometry in a guidestar image header to 
an standard tangent projection with very slightly degraded accuracy.   

The procedures in this directory will call the procedures wcssph2xy.pro
and wcsxy2sph.pro in the /astro directory 

A couple of procedures in other directories also use the FITS world coordinate
system including
  IMCONTOUR - (in /astro) Contour plots with astronomical labeling (either 
               RA,Dec or arc distance from the image center
  IMDBASE - (in /database) Find all catalog sources within the field of an 
            image (given a FITS header with astrometry)
